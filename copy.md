 Boiling a kettle? Could you wait 5 minutes?
 APPNAME shows the user the current status of the UK electricity grid, visualising when 
 the grid is under demand, and when it is producing excess energy. APPNAME can also send a
 notification when the grid has been under demand but is now exceeding it. Using appliances such
 as kettles when there is less demand can help lower the carbon emissions of the grid.
 
 APPNAME allows you to;
 * Visualise the status of the grid in realtime
 * Receive a push notification when the grid is under less demand.
 
 The electrical grid is constantly trying to match power supply to demand, and at various
 times throughout the day the grid is either over-producing resulting in excess power, or 
 under-producing and struggling to keep up with demand. In order to keep up with sudden 
 demand for power, the grid often uses more inefficient means of generation, which produces
 more carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.
 
 APPNAME visualises the grid so users can decide weather they want a coffee or tea now, or
 if they wish to wait until the grid is under less demand.
