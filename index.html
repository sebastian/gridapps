        <p><span class="highlight"><span class="tm">Tea?</span> shows the user the current status of the UK electricity grid, visualising when the grid is under demand, and when it is producing excess energy. <span class="tm">Tea?</span> can also send a notification when the grid has been under demand but is now exceeding it. Using appliances such as kettles when there is less demand can help lower the carbon emissions of the grid.</span></p>

        <p><span class="highlight"><span class="tm">Tea?</span> allows you to</span></p>
        <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Visualise the status of the grid in realtime</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Receive a push notification when the grid is under less demand</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p><span class="highlight">The electrical grid is constantly trying to match power supply to demand, and at various times throughout the day the grid is either over-producing resulting in excess power, or under-producing and struggling to keep up with demand. In order to keep up with sudden demand for power, the grid often uses more inefficient means of generation, which produces
        more carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.</span></p>

        <p><span class="highlight"><span class="tm">Tea?</span> visualises the grid so users can decide weather they want a coffee or tea now, or if they wish to wait until the grid is under less demand.</span></p>
